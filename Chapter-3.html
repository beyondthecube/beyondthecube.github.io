Blockbuilding: breaking down a problem into substeps</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When you are stuck in the beginning of figuring out a problem,
you should think about if you are making some unnecessary assumptions
that limits your creative thinking.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember the requirements for a good starting step we found from the
previous chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This step itself shouldn’t be too difficult</li>
<li>It should leave enough freedom to turn the cube, so that the
unsolved pieces can be shuffled around without destroying what you
already solved</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In the previous chapter, we found a few first step
candidates, what’s the thinking process used to find them, and why none
of the candidates found by this process is a good one?</strong><br />
The candidates we listed last chapter, solving a face, an outer layer,
an inner layer, edges, or corners, are those that are apparently not
very difficult to solve and the parts of the cube being solved is easily
recognizable. The problem is that none of these candidates satisfy the
second requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Can you change the thought process to avoid this
problem?</strong><br />
When you are stuck in the beginning of figuring out a problem, you
should think about if you are making some unnecessary assumptions that
limits your creative thinking. In the previous thought process, we
filtered the first-step candidates first by the first requirement of
being apparently easy to solve, then by the second one, leaving enough
room of freedom. But why do we need to filter by this order? Can better
candidates be found by filtering using the second requirement first?</p>
<p><strong>Without focusing on what exactly should be solved and if it
is easy to solve, what would be an example of “enough freedom to shuffle
around pieces” that doesn’t affect too many pieces?</strong><br />
If there are more layers that are free to turn, less pieces can be
solved to keep them free, so keeping 2 outer layers free can be a good
idea:<br />

In fact, the pieces can get quite scrambled just turning these 2 layers,
if still haven’t scrambled the cube try scrambling these 2 layers first,
look at how scrambled it gets, <strong>then you really should get the
whole cube scrambled and follow along</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How many pieces can you solve while still keeping these 2
layers free to turn?</strong><br />
All pieces that aren’t on these 2 layers obviously won’t be affected by
turning these 2 layers. These pieces form a 2x2x3 block shown in this
picture (the free-to-turn layers are moved to the back and bottom layers
to show the “block” more clearly):<br />

<p><strong>Note.</strong> Solving this 2x2x3 block doesn’t necessarily
mean that the rest of the cube can be solved by turning only these 2
layers marked in green, and thus we can infer that there are more things
we can solve that won’t be messed up by just turning these 2 layers.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand what I’m saying, we will
re-encounter and try to solve this problem with an improved knowledge of
the cube in chapter 6.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using the thought process that you used to figure out how
to assemble the last layer, can you find a way to solve the 2x2x3
block?</em></strong> This can be broken down into substeps:</p>
<p><strong>What should be the cube look like 1 turn before you solve the
3x2x2 block??</strong> Notice that for any position where you can reach
some goal in 1 turn, by reversing the process these positions are those
that can be reached by doing a 1-turn scramble from your goal
position.</p>
<p>There are 2 possibilities after scrambling the block by 1 turn. You
can get a 2x2x2 block and a 2x2x1 square: <br>

Or 2 3x2x1 blocks, one on the outer layer, consisting of 2 corners, 3
edges, and 1 center, the other on a middle layer, consisting of 3
centers and 2 edges: <br>
<embed	src="https://visualcube.api.cubing.net/visualcube.php?fmt=svg&amp;size=200&amp;pzl=3&amp;fc=dwwdwwdwwgggrrdddddoogggddd&amp;arw=F2F0-green" /></p>
<p>In this article we’ll just use the first case as the position to
reach before solving the block, as the methods are the same for the
second case and currently we just need to find 1 way to reach the 3x2x2
block.</p>
<p><strong>Can you use a similar way to figure out how to solve the
2x2x2 block and the 2x2x1 square?</strong> Using the same process as the
previous question, let’s look at the 2x2x2 block first. This time there
is only 1 possibility after scrambling it by 1 turn: a 2x2x1 square and
a center-edge-center line <br><embed
					      src="https://visualcube.api.cubing.net/visualcube.php?fmt=svg&amp;size=200&amp;pzl=3&amp;fc=dwwdwwddddggrrddddddddggddd&amp;arw=R2R0-y" /><br>
*Now you probably realize why I decided to use the first case, as the
2x2x2 block is more symmetrical than the 3x2x1 block there are less
possibilities to consider, also, the 2x2x1 square is the same as the
other block we need to consider for this step.</p>
<p>You are probably getting the feel of this: solve some pieces together
into a small block, and combine them to make a middle-sized block, solve
another middle-sized block and combine them into a large block. This is
why this way of solving the cube is called “blockbuilding”.</p>
<p>But blockbuilding is much deeper than this, real “blockbuilding” is
the thought process you just went through, it is about working out a
puzzle from the solved state, step by step, back to the almost-scrambled
state that can be solved easily. This understanding of blockbuilding
allows it to be used in a lot other puzzles and problems where
apparently there are no “blocks” to “build” (as in chapter 2 of part
2).</p>
<p><strong>Do we need to further break down the center-edge-center line
into sub-blocks?</strong> Remember from the forword that the centers are
fixes, so you are only solving 1 piece between the right centers, this
shouldn’t be very difficult and you should try to figure out how to do
this by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>But the 2x2x1 square needs to be further broken down
right?</strong> Yes, and there is only 1 possible way to break it down
into smaller sub-blocks. A corner-edge pair and a center-edge pair:

<p><strong>Reverse this breaking down and arrange a set of steps to
build the 3x2x2 block.</strong> 1. Make a corner-edge pair 2. Make a
center -edge pair that should be next to it 3. Join the pairs made in
steps 1 and 2 to make a 2x2x1 square 4. Make the corresponding
center-edge-center line by inserting the right edge between the right
centers 5. Join the blocks made in steps 3 and 4 to make a 2x2x2 square
6. Make another corner-edge pair that belongs to one of the 2x2x1
squares next to the 2x2x2 square 7. Make the corresponding center-edge
pair 8. Join the pairs made in steps 6 and 7 to make a 2x2x1 square 9.
Join the blocks made in steps 5 and 8 to make a 3x2x2 square</p>
<p>The next two chapters will be a bit different, instead of guiding you
with questions, sub-questions, visual explanations, and answers, it
would be like a list and answers of frequently asked questions. Don’t
read them right away. As I mentioned in the forword, practice is the
best way to learn to solve a puzzle, what you should do is to try to
build a 3x2x2 block on your cube by yourself, and when you are stuck
somewhere, look it up in the chapters 4 and 5 and see if your question
got answered there. If you really got stuck, in the end of each chapter
there will also be a systematic set of instructions to solve the 2x2x2
and expanding it into a 3x2x2 block, but I really advise you to try to
find your own way and not to read it unless you are completely
stuck.</p>
