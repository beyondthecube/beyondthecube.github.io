# 3. Blockbuilding: Breaking Down a Problem Into Substeps

Remember the requirements for a good starting step we found from the
previous chapter:\

1.  This step itself shouldn't be too difficult
2.  It should leave enough freedom to turn the cube, so that the
    unsolved pieces can be shuffled around without destroying what you
    already solved

**In the previous chapter, we found a few first step candidates, what's
the thinking process used to find them, and why none of the candidates
found by this process is a good one?**\
The candidates we listed last chapter, solving a face, an outer layer,
an inner layer, edges, or corners, are those that are apparently not
very difficult to solve and the parts of the cube being solved is easily
recognizable. The problem is that none of these candidates satisfy the
second requirement.

**Can you change the thought process to avoid this problem?**\
When you are stuck in the beginning of figuring out a problem, you
should think about if you are making some unnecessary assumptions that
limits your creative thinking. In the previous thought process, we
filtered the first-step candidates first by the first requirement of
being apparently easy to solve, then by the second one, leaving enough
room of freedom. But why do we need to filter by this order? Can better
candidates be found by filtering using the second requirement first?

**Without focusing on what exactly should be solved and if it is easy to
solve, what would be an example of "enough freedom to shuffle around
pieces" that doesn't affect too many pieces?**\
If there are more layers that are free to turn, less pieces can be
solved to keep them free, so keeping 2 outer layers free can be a good
idea:\
\
In fact, the pieces can get quite scrambled just turning these 2 layers,
if still haven't scrambled the cube try scrambling these 2 layers first,
look at how scrambled it gets, **then you really should get the whole
cube scrambled and follow along**.

**How many pieces can you solve while still keeping these 2 layers free
to turn?**\
All pieces that aren't on these 2 layers obviously won't be affected by
turning these 2 layers. These pieces form a 2x2x3 block shown in this
picture (the free-to-turn layers are moved to the back and bottom layers
to show the "block" more clearly):\

**Note.** Solving this 2x2x3 block doesn't necessarily mean that the
rest of the cube can be solved by turning only these 2 layers marked in
green, and thus we can infer that there are more things we can solve
that won't be messed up by just turning these 2 layers. Don't worry if
you don't understand what I'm saying, we will re-encounter and try to
solve this problem with an improved knowledge of the cube in chapter 6.

***Using the thought process that you used to figure out how to assemble
the last layer, can you find a way to solve the 2x2x3 block?***\
This can be broken down into substeps:

-   **What should be the cube look like 1 turn before you solve the
    3x2x2 block?** Notice that for any position where you can reach some
    goal in 1 turn, by reversing the process these positions are those
    that can be reached by doing a 1-turn scramble from your goal
    position.

    There are 2 possibilities after scrambling the block by 1 turn. You
    can get a 2x2x2 block and a 2x2x1 square:\
    \
    Or 2 3x2x1 blocks, one on the outer layer, consisting of 2 corners,
    3 edges, and 1 center, the other on a middle layer, consisting of 3
    centers and 2 edges:\

    In this article we'll just use the first case as the position to
    reach before solving the block, as the methods are the same for the
    second case and currently we just need to find 1 way to reach the
    3x2x2 block.

-   **Can you use a similar way to figure out how to solve the 2x2x2
    block and the 2x2x1 square?** Using the same process as the previous
    question, let's look at the 2x2x2 block first. This time there is
    only 1 possibility after scrambling it by 1 turn: a 2x2x1 square and
    a center-edge-center line\

    \*Now you probably realize why I decided to use the first case, as
    the 2x2x2 block is more symmetrical than the 3x2x1 block there are
    less possibilities to consider, also, the 2x2x1 square is the same
    as the other block we need to consider for this step.

    You are probably getting the feel of this: solve some pieces
    together into a small block, and combine them to make a middle-sized
    block, solve another middle-sized block and combine them into a
    large block. This is why this way of solving the cube is called
    "blockbuilding".

    But blockbuilding is much deeper than this, real "blockbuilding" is
    the thought process you just went through, it is about working out a
    puzzle from the solved state, step by step, back to the
    almost-scrambled state that can be solved easily. This understanding
    of blockbuilding allows it to be used in a lot other puzzles and
    problems where apparently there are no "blocks" to "build" (as in
    chapter 2 of part 2).

-   **Do we need to further break down the center-edge-center line into
    sub-blocks?**\
    Remember from the forword that the centers are fixes, so you are
    only solving 1 piece between the right centers, this shouldn't be
    very difficult and you should try to figure out how to do this by
    yourself.

-   **But the 2x2x1 square needs to be further broken down right?**\
    Yes, and there is only 1 possible way to break it down into smaller
    sub-blocks. A corner-edge pair and a center-edge pair:\

**Reverse this breaking down and arrange a set of steps to build the
3x2x2 block.**

1.  Make a corner-edge pair
2.  Make a center -edge pair that should be next to it
3.  Join the pairs made in steps 1 and 2 to make a 2x2x1 square
4.  Make the corresponding center-edge-center line by inserting the
    right edge between the right centers
5.  Join the blocks made in steps 3 and 4 to make a 2x2x2 square
6.  Make another corner-edge pair that belongs to one of the 2x2x1
    squares next to the 2x2x2 square
7.  Make the corresponding center-edge pair
8.  Join the pairs made in steps 6 and 7 to make a 2x2x1 square
9.  Join the blocks made in steps 5 and 8 to make a 3x2x2 square

The next two chapters will be a bit different, instead of guiding you
with questions, sub-questions, visual explanations, and answers, it
would be like a list and answers of frequently asked questions. Don't
read them right away. As I mentioned in the forword, practice is the
best way to learn to solve a puzzle, what you should do is to try to
build a 3x2x2 block on your cube by yourself, and when you are stuck
somewhere, look it up in the chapters 4 and 5 and see if your question
got answered there. If you really got stuck, in the end of each chapter
there will also be a systematic set of instructions to solve the 2x2x2
and expanding it into a 3x2x2 block, but I really advise you to try to
find your own way and not to read it unless you are completely stuck.
