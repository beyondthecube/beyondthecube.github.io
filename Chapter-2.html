<p>Knowing that solving a face doesn’t solve anything, naturally, you
may be thinking:<br />
<strong><em>Is solving a layer, meaning not just solving a face but also
putting all pieces on that face in the right order, a good way to start
solving the cube?</em></strong>

</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of tutorials online (and probably the one that came
with your cube) teach a method that solves the cube one layer at a time.
I first learned to solve the cube using this method as well, but as my
experience grew, I stopped appreciating this method as I realized that
this seemingly logical approach is actually full of flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other criteria for a good “first step candidate”
apart from actually solving something?</strong><br />
One obvious criterion is that the first step itself shouldn’t be too
difficult, as if you are often stuck on the first step you won’t get the
chance to solve more of the cube.<br />
The second criterion is important in all kinds of problem-solving:
<strong><em>when you are planning steps to solve a problem, especially
the first steps, for every step you plan, you should try to make future
steps not so difficult, often by leaving more degrees of freedom after
each step, the best step is usually not the most obvious
one</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you explain why solving all edges first or solving
the “T” in the previous chapter aren’t good ideas for a first
step?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solving a layer isn’t difficult, but how easy will future
progress be if you solve a layer?</strong><br />
Look again at this cube with a layer solved:<br />

As you can see from this diagram, only 2 of the 4 outer layers marked in
green can be turned without breaking the solved layer, any turns on the
other 4 layers marked in red will destroy your previous progress.</p>
<p><strong>How much can you do with these 2 free layers?</strong><br />
Imagine turning these 2 layers a bit and you’ll realize: nothing. Since
the 2 layers are parallel, meaning they don’t intersect, you can’t move
any piece from one layer onto the other, and thus you can’t shuffle
around pieces on one layer.</p>
<p><strong>Wait, then how are there tutorials that solve the cube layer
by layer?</strong><br />
These tutorials use a special “algorithm”, a sequence of moves that you
need to memorize, to do things like inserting edges into the second
layer and shuffling pieces around on the last layer. All these
algorithms break up your previous progress and restore them while
solving more pieces. These algorithms are generally quite unintuitive
and very difficult to figure out by yourself. Though most of them can be
explained by what you will learn in the second appendix, they only
become obvious once you have already seen the solution.</p>
<p><strong>What about solving all the corners first? That leaves a lot
of middle layers free to move, and if we only care about keeping the 4
bottom corners and the 4 top corners together respectively, the top and
bottom layers are also free, that’s a lot of freedom to move the pieces,
would it be a good way to solve the cube?</strong><br />
Solving the corners first is one of the earliest discovered methods to
solve the Rubik’s cube, it satisfies the second criterion quite well,
but it fails on the first one: try solving all the corners, and you will
realize that it’s not as simple as you expected.</p>
<p>Why is it difficult? When you solve a face or a layer, you have
enough room to store the needed piece (say on another layer), before
aligning everything and moving them to the correct spot, but if you want
to solve all corners, you are solving all pieces of one type, and that
means there is no way to store the last few corners in another spot
before inserting them in the right way.</p>
<p>Think about which one is easier: swapping 2 corners on the first
layer while allowed to break up the other 2 layers, or swapping 2
corners without breaking anything else on a 2x2x2 cube, which is
equivalent to all corners on the 3x3x3 cube.<br />

<p>As I mentioned before, the best step is usually not the most obvious
one. To find the best first step, I’m going to introduce another
problem-solving approach, probably the most important one in the whole
article: <strong>blockbuilding</strong>, and it’s not just about
building blocks.</p>
